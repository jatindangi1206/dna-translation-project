# üåü DNA Translation Project üåü

### üß¨ Introduction to DNA Translation
DNA translation is a fundamental process in molecular biology where the genetic code carried by DNA is converted into proteins. The sequence of nucleotides in DNA (adenine [A], thymine [T], guanine [G], and cytosine [C]) is transcribed into RNA (where thymine is replaced by uracil [U]), which is then translated into a sequence of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. This process is crucial for the synthesis of proteins, which perform a myriad of functions in living organisms.

### üî¨ How DNA Translation Works
1. **Transcription**: DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) by the enzyme RNA polymerase. In RNA, thymine (T) is replaced by uracil (U).
2. **Translation**: The mRNA is then read by ribosomes in the cell cytoplasm. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome in the correct sequence, as dictated by the mRNA codons (a sequence of three nucleotides).
3. **Protein Synthesis**: The ribosome assembles the amino acids into a polypeptide chain, forming a protein.

# üöÄ How to Run the App

### üõ† Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask**

  ```bash
  # if you do not have these
  pip install python
  pip install flask
  ```

- **Docker** (optional, for containerized setup)

### üíª Running Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jatindangi1206/dna-translation-project.git
    cd dna-translation
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. **Access the Application**
    Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### üê≥ Running with Docker

1. **Build the Docker Image**
    ```bash
    docker build -t dna-translation .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 5000:5000 dna-translation
    ```

3. **Access the Application**
    Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### üìã Usage

1. **Open the Web Application**: Access the application via your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2. **Enter Your Sequence**:
   - Input the DNA or RNA sequence directly in the text area.
   - Alternatively, upload a FASTA file containing your sequence.

3. **Select the Type**: Choose whether your input sequence is DNA or RNA.

4. **Submit**: Click the "Translate" button to perform the translation.

5. **View Results**: The translated sequence will be displayed on the page.

### üåê Deploying on GitHub Pages

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**
    - If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub and push your project to it.

2. **Install `ghp-import`**
    ```bash
    pip install ghp-import
    ```

3. **Build the Static Files**
    ```bash
    flask freeze
    ```

4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
    ```bash
    ghp-import -n -p -f build
    ```

5. **Enable GitHub Pages**
    - Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
    - Under the "Pages" section, select the branch and folder where your static files are located (usually `gh-pages` branch and `/` folder).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring GitHub Actions for Automatic Deployment

1. **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow**
    - In your repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory if it doesn't exist.
    - Create a new file named `deploy.yml` in the `.github/workflows` directory.

2. **Add the Following Content to `deploy.yml`**
    ```yaml
    name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
        - name: Checkout repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Set up Python
          uses: actions/setup-python@v2
          with:
            python-version: 3.x

        - name: Install dependencies
          run: |
            python -m pip install --upgrade pip
            pip install flask ghp-import

        - name: Build static files
          run: flask freeze

        - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
          run: |
            ghp-import -n -p -f build
    ```

3. **Commit and Push**
    - Commit and push the `deploy.yml` file to your repository.

4. **Automatic Deployment**
    - GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your app to GitHub Pages whenever you push changes to the `main` branch.
